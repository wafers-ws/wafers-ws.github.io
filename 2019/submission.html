					<h3> Main Goal </h3>
					<p> The goal of the workshop is to provide a common forum where researchers from across the world can debate 
						new research ideas and directions on novel dependability assessment approaches for cyber-physical and complex systems 
						by gathering researchers and practitioners working on cypher-physical research topics and related areas such as 
						data communication in cyber-physical networks, safety and security of cyber-physical and critical systems, 
						automated verification and validation of critical systems.</p>
						
					<h3> Topics of the Workshop </h3>
					<p> The workshop aims at discussing current state of the art, emerging challenges and trends, as well as novel solutions 
						for cyber-physical and critical systems validation. Workshop topics include, but are not limited to: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Software assessment to cope with increasing system complexity</li>
						<li>Assessment of integrated systems including software OTS and legacy software</li>
						<li>Agile development in critical systems: assessment challenges and approaches</li>
						<li>Automated verification and validation of critical systems</li>
						<li>Certification of complex and integrated systems</li>
						<li>Dynamic and evolving systems: new needs for V&V and certification</li>
						<li>Model-driven approaches for the assessment of dependable and secure systems</li>
						<li>Dependable and secure cloud systems and virtualized environments</li>
						<li>Secure data communication in cyber-physical networks</li>
						<li>Experimental assessment of dependability and security</li>
						<li>Tools and demos for the assessment of complex systems</li>
						<li>Practical experiences and testbeds related with safety and security of cyber-physical systems</li>
						<li>Industrial experiences and best practices for safety and security of cyber-physical systems</li>
						<li>Open issues, practical experiences and real-world case studies.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h3> Submission Guidelines </h3>
					
					<p> Research Papers, Practical Experience Reports, and Short Papers should be respectively no longer than 10 pages, 6 pages and 4 pages, following the IEEE two-column format for conference proceedings. 
					The category of the paper should be clearly marked in the first page. 
					Authors are requested to first register their submissions and then submit their manuscripts in PDF format at the <a href="https://submissoes.sbc.org.br/ladc2019_wafers">JEMS</a> webpage. 
					JEMS limits to a maximum of 8 authors per paper. More than 8 authors is allowed, but must be indicated to the TPC chairs after acceptance notification. </p>
					
					<h3> Important Dates </h3>
					<h5> Paper Submission: Oct 2nd, 2019 (Extended)</h5>
					<h5> Notification: Oct 10th, 2019 </h5>
					<h5> Camera Ready: Oct 14th, 2019 </h5>
					
					Note: Submission deadline falls after notification deadline of LADC. Feel free to resubmit paper that did not have luck at the main conference (if any), that may adequately fit the purpose of WAFERS.
