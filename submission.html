					<h3> Main Goal </h3>
					<p> The main goal of the WAFERS workshop is to discuss novel dependability assessment approaches for complex CPSs and to promote their adoption in real-world systems through industrial and academic research. The aim of the WAFERS workshop is to promote and foster discussion on novel ideas, constituting a forum where researchers can share both real problems and innovative solutions for the assessment of complex systems.</p>
						
					<h3> Topics of the Workshop </h3>
					<p> The workshop aims at discussing current state of the art, emerging challenges and trends, as well as novel solutions 
						for cyber-physical and critical systems validation. Workshop topics include, but are not limited to: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Software Assessment to cope with increasing System Complexity</li>
						<li>Assessment of integrated systems including software OTS and legacy software</li>
						<li>Agile development in critical systems: assessment challenges and approaches</li>
						<li>Architectures for Complex Cyber-Physical Systems-of-Systems</li>
						<li>Automated verification and validation of critical systems</li>
						<li>Certification of Complex and integrated Systems</li>
						<li>Dynamic and evolving systems: new needs for verification, validation and certification</li>
						<li>Model-driven approaches for the assessment of dependable and secure systems</li>
						<li>Dependable and secure cloud systems and virtualized environments</li>
						<li>Secure data communication in cyber-physical networks</li>
						<li>Experimental assessment of dependability and security</li>
						<li>Tools and demos for the assessment of complex systems</li>
						<li>Practical experiences and testbeds related to safety and security of cyber-physical systems</li>
						<li>Industrial experiences and best practices relevant to safety and security of cyber-physical systems</li>
						<li>Open issues, practical experiences and real-world case studies</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h3> Submission Guidelines </h3>
					
					<p> WAFERS accpets papers in two categories: <i>Research Papers</i> and <i>Emerging Ideas Papers</i>. Submissions should be respectively no longer than 8 pages and 4 pages, following the <a class="wiki external" target="_blank" href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html" rel="external" data-unsp-sanitized="clean">IEEE two-column format for conference proceedings</a><span class="icon icon-link-external fa fa-external-link fa-fw "></span>. The category of the paper should be clearly marked on the first page. Authors are requested to first register their submissions and then submit their manuscripts in PDF format at the <a class="wiki external" target="_blank" href="https://submissoes.sbc.org.br/ladc2021-wafers" rel="external" data-unsp-sanitized="clean">JEMS webpage</a><span class="icon icon-link-external fa fa-external-link fa-fw "></span>.
					JEMS limits to a maximum of 8 authors per paper. More than 8 authors is allowed, but must be indicated to the TPC chairs after acceptance notification. </p>
					
					<h3> Important Dates </h3>
					<h5> Paper Submission: September 5th, 2021</h5>
					<h5> Notification: September 24th, 2021 </h5>
					<h5> Camera Ready: Oct 5th, 2021 </h5>
					
					Note: Submission deadline falls after notification deadline of LADC. Feel free to resubmit your paper that did not have luck at the main conference (if any) and may adequately fit the scope of WAFERS.
